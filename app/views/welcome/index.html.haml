            Do you have a lot of data

        %p
          That's why we created TeamStatus.TV - we had the same pain.
        %p
          You have all those great tools. Issues in JIRA, reviews in Crucible, business data elsewhere.
        %p
          You know that an informed team makes better decision and people knowing the big picture feel more motivated.
        %p
          So you probably want to have a central place (like we do) when you can go to see the most important data.
        %p Imagine:

        %ul.questions
          %li You have a reference point during stand ups
          %li You can check the state of continuous integration with one glimpse
          %li You have good data
          %li You can make good decisions
          %li All team members are on the same page

        %p
          And, while you're imagining that lovely scenarioâ€¦ What if you could instantly see, no jumping through different systems required, how your project is doing?

      .block
        %h2.title-divider
          %span
            Do you want to focus on your work
            %span.de-em instead of doing stats?
        %p
          We love the tools we use, but even more we love having one central place to keep the data about our project.
        %p
          When you use TeamStatus.TV you get the benefit of using a tool designed to help you get the most of your other tools, to understand:

        %ul.answers
          %li number of issues in progress
          %li list of support inqueries
          %li current state of continuos integration
          %li how many code reviews are open

        %p
          In addition you can build your own custom integrations, so you can tailor it to your needs.

        %p We've built it thinking about your needs, tailored for:
        %ul.teams
          %li teams that do software development
          %li support engineers
          %li devops and sysadmins
